// Hello,

// My education is in Economics and that's where I had my first taste of
// a coding language. Since then I have stepped through quite a few
// financial companies, but it has ultimately led me back into coding and more
// specifically into web development.

// Iâ€™m based in Nashville and think of my self as a person focused
// on self-improvement whether it's every project or something even more personal
// like health and exercise.

// if I dont know it I'll figure it out
