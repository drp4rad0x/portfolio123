#### Step 1: Set up and planning

1. Set up your HTML and CSS files with some simple dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.
2. Set up your git repository (refer to past projects if you need a refresher).
3. Download a full-resolution copy of the design files ([desktop](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/1c8b5c739efd263e8cc48703988b18d6e3afe034/advanced_html_css/responsive-design/project_personal_portfolio/imgs/portfolio.png), [tablet](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/1c8b5c739efd263e8cc48703988b18d6e3afe034/advanced_html_css/responsive-design/project_personal_portfolio/imgs/portfolio%20tablet.png), [mobile](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/1c8b5c739efd263e8cc48703988b18d6e3afe034/advanced_html_css/responsive-design/project_personal_portfolio/imgs/portfolio%20mobile.png)), and get a general idea for how you're going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.

#### Step 2: Gather Assets

1. The portraits we've used in the design files are stock photos downloaded from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/). If you don't have a picture of yourself handy, feel free to go grab a placeholder for now.
2. Select your fonts! We're using `Playfair Display` and `Roboto` in the design, both available with Google fonts.
3. In the design we have icon-links for GitHub, LinkedIn and Twitter. Obviously feel free to add whatever links you want to your own site. We got those icons from [https://devicon.dev/](https://devicon.dev/).
4. Other icons (phone, email and external link) were downloaded as SVGs from [https://materialdesignicons.com/](https://materialdesignicons.com/).

#### Step 3: Some Tips!

1. As you might expect, you can organize your work on this project however you please. We've given you many tips over the past several lessons, and you are likely already comfortable starting from a blank page.
2. If you like being told what to do: The author of this lesson feels most comfortable starting out with the larger sections of the layout, and then working from the top of the page to the bottom. In other words, get the various sections in more or less the right place (header, projects, contact etc.) while ignoring a lot of specific style and content details, then go back through from the top-to-bottom filling-in, styling and cleaning up everything.
3. It doesn't matter when or how you accomplish the responsiveness of this project. There are people who will tell you that you should always start with the mobile experience and then use media-queries to tell your layout how to expand. The 'mobile-first' crew _does_ have some good points (Google it!) but in the end, how you accomplish it doesn't matter as long as it works. Good luck!
4. When you're done, don't forget to push it to GitHub, and use GitHub Pages to publish it to the world! You should be proud of what you've accomplished here!
